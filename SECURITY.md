# AI Dev Federation Dashboard - Security Notes

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This document outlines the **security considerations** for the AI-Dev-Federation-Dashboard.  
As a platform that integrates with **GitHub, Hugging Face, and local persistence**, security practices are built into the system to safeguard API keys, data, and execution flows.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Core Risks

### 1. API Keys & Secrets
**Used**: Hugging Face API key, GitHub tokens (fine-grained or classic)  

**Risks**:  
- Leak of tokens could expose private repos or AI usage quotas  
- API abuse if keys are mishandled  

**Mitigations**:  
- `.env` strictly ignored in `.gitignore`  
- Keys only loaded at runtime with `dotenv`  
- Debug logs never print secrets  

---

### 2. Repository Access (GitHub API)
**Retreives**: Repo trees, file contents, commit SHAs  

**Risks**:  
- Potential over-fetching or rate limit abuse  
- Unauthorized access if tokens are exposed  

**Mitigations**:  
- Branch/SHA resolution ensures deterministic requests  
- Requests default to unauthenticated where possible (read-only)  
- Tokens only used when needed (fallback)  

---

### 3. AI Completions (Hugging Face API)
**Collected**: Context, repo excerpts, task metadata  

**Risks**:  
- Large file context could unintentionally expose sensitive code  
- External dependency â†’ subject to latency/outages  

**Mitigations**:  
- File content truncated (`max_chars`) before sending  
- Only relevant repo slices passed to completions  
- Backoff/retry with logging for reliability  

---

### 4. Persistence & Memory
**Stored**: Users, tasks, audit logs, conversation memory  

**Risks**:  
- PII limited to emails in users table  
- Guest users stored with `NULL` IDs (no direct identifiers)  

**Mitigations**:  
- SQLite is local-only (not exposed to the internet)  
- Easy migration path to PostgreSQL for production-grade encryption  
- Audit log tracks all requests (role, endpoint, timestamp)  

---

### 5. Guest Rate Limiting
**Risks**:  
- Guests could overload system with repeated task runs  

**Mitigations**:  
- Middleware enforces **5 tasks/minute per guest**  
- Additional audit logging for abnormal behavior  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Security-by-Design Principles

- **Least Privilege** â†’ Minimal data persisted; guests logged anonymously  
- **Zero Secrets in Repo** â†’ API keys never committed; all in `.env`  
- **Scoped Tokens** â†’ GitHub fine-grained tokens preferred for limited scope  
- **Audit Everywhere** â†’ Middleware + DB logging captures all access attempts  

---

## âš¡ Gaps & Future Improvements

- No malware scanning or validation for uploaded assets (currently static)  
- SQLite is not production-ready â†’ migrate to PostgreSQL for hardened storage  
- No rate limiting for authenticated members yet (only guests)  
- No automated intrusion detection/alerting pipeline  

---

âœ… This dashboard demonstrates **security-aware design** across all integrations:

- Secrets isolated and never exposed  
- GitHub + Hugging Face integrations carefully scoped  
- Audit + rate limiting enforced by middleware
